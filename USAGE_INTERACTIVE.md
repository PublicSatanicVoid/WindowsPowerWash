## PowerWash: Interactive Usage Guide
This short guide walks you through how to use PowerWash in the "interactive usage" mode, which prompts you whether to enable each feature.

### Setup
- You only need to download `[PowerWash.ps1](https://github.com/UniverseCraft/WindowsPowerWash/tree/main/PowerWash.ps1)` to use PowerWash interactively.
- Make sure your [`ExecutionPolicy`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7.3) allows scripts to run

### Usage
- Open a PowerShell prompt as an Administrator
- `cd` to the directory containing `PowerWash.ps1`, e.g.: `cd C:\Users\User\Downloads`
- Run PowerWash: `.\PowerWash.ps1`
- You will be prompted step by step which PowerWash features you want to use.
