On my to-do list: (feel free to suggest more!)
- Only run secondary DISM integrity check if SFC fails
- Skip registry tweaks on Home editions that only work on Pro
- Hunt down more telemetry things to disable (there's always more)
- More extensive validation
  - admx.help has lots of good info on registry values that are otherwise undocumented
  - before/after comparisons across more devices
- Ability to uninstall Edge
- Ability to install configured set of apps via winget, like Notepad++, Chrome, VSCode, Discord, Windows Terminal, PowerToys, Git
