On my to-do list: (feel free to suggest more!)
- Only run secondary DISM integrity check if SFC fails
- Skip installing gpedit on Pro editions (it's already there)
- Skip registry tweaks on Home editions that only work on Pro
- Hunt down more telemetry things to disable (there's always more)
- More extensive validation
