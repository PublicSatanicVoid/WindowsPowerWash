On my to-do list: (feel free to suggest more!)
- Only run secondary DISM integrity check if SFC fails
- Hunt down more telemetry things to disable (there's always more)
- More extensive validation
  - admx.help has lots of good info on registry values that are otherwise undocumented
  - before/after comparisons across more devices
- Fully uninstall Edge (just using its setup.exe is not enough apparently)
- Fully validate effects of disabling Defender
- Double check IRQ conflict detection
