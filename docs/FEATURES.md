## How It Works
The default Windows installation has to cater to a very wide variety of users, and generally makes tradeoffs that sacrifice some degree of performance and responsiveness in exchange for power management, data collection, etc.

PowerWash modifies various aspects of your Windows installation. It configures your system to aggressively choose maximum performance and minimum latency over power saving. (Note: Many of the changes intentionally do not apply when on battery). It also removes bloatware and unwanted default programs, and generally cleans up the out-of-box experience. It does this through a combination of registry changes, application package removals, PowerShell cmdlets, and more.

## Feature Support

Some editions of Windows do not have the necessary components to support certain PowerWash features. PowerWash does not impose any artificial limitations and the author continues to look for ways around Microsoft's. All features listed below are optional and configurable using the provided [`PowerWashSettings.json`](https://github.com/UniverseCraft/WindowsPowerWash/tree/main/PowerWashSettings.json). (See [the documentation](https://github.com/UniverseCraft/WindowsPowerWash/tree/main/docs/USAGE_CONFIG.md)).

### Scans and checks

| ------- | :----: | :---: | :--------------------: | ----------- |
| System integrity checks | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Runs Microsoft's built-in [system file integrity checks](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files-79aa86cb-ca52-166a-92a3-966e85d4094e) to repair any corrupted system files |
| Check for IRQ conflicts | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Sharing interrupt request lines among multiple devices can degrade performance. This cannot be fixed from within the software. |

## Suggestions and Tips
- I recommend you use programs like [LatencyMon](https://www.resplendence.com/latencymon) and [WhySoSlow](https://www.resplendence.com/whysoslow) to benchmark your system before and after running PowerWash and any other optimizations.
- This script should be accompanied by a manual review of preinstalled programs, devices, services, etc. to disable or uninstall unwanted software.
- Adequate thermal management is imperative to stable device functioning. Make sure your device is being cooled adequately.
- You can also overclock CPU/GPU/RAM if needed, but this is a "brute force" approach and you should try to get performance as high as possible before resorting to this. May also compromise thermals, so make sure to use long-running stability tests like [Prime95](https://www.mersenne.org/download/) (CPU, RAM), [Kombustor](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/kombustor/) (CPU, GPU), and [Memtest86](https://www.memtest86.com/) (RAM).
- Using SSD instead of HDD, and NVMe instead of SATA, can drastically improve system responsiveness and application load times, though likely won't help with most causes of high interrupt latency.
- Make sure all drivers are up to date. When installing or reinstalling, __perform clean installs where possible__.
- Always back up your system before running PowerWash or making any other system configuration changes.
- After installing a Windows update, you may need to re-run PowerWash as updates have been known to spontaneously re-enable certain features.
- Obviously, all of this is "use at your own risk"

## Special Thank-Yous
- While many freely available sites have contributed valuable knowledge in the development of this script, I especially want to thank the maintainers of [admx.help](https://admx.help) for providing an easy-to-use and comprehensive inventory of Group Policy and associated registry settings. Also, as bad a reputation as Microsoft has for user-friendliness, their technical documentation at [learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com) is generally very high quality.
- All beta testers
