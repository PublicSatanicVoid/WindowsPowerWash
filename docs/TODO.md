On my to-do list: (feel free to suggest more!) (bolded are priorities)
- **Disk cleanup**
- **Fully validate Hyper-V enablement on Home editions**
- Hunt down more telemetry things to disable (there's always more)
- More extensive validation
  - admx.help has lots of good info on registry values that are otherwise undocumented
  - before/after comparisons across more devices
- Fully validate effects of disabling Defender
- Undo for features that it makes sense on
